* No browser usage. All coding is to be done without the use of a browser preview.
* Snippets and Emmet are allowed for creation of markup
* Each round is 20 minutes and upon completion of time, competitors will step away from computer keyboard and view audience-facing monitor to see result.
* Voting will be done by the audience. In the result of a tie, the referees will have the final say on the winner.
